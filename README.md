# Flood Data Ecosystem 
Data that could enable more effective disaster-risk response and management is scattered or siloed across different agencies, at different scales and formats, making it difficult for decision-makers and relevant stakeholders to make data-informed decisions. The availability of good quality, machine-readable, and interoperable data is crucial for effective climate action and disaster response. However, in India, this data is fragmented and siloed, scattered across different agencies, making it difficult for decision-makers to make data-informed decisions in a timely manner.

The repository contains codes to extract datasets relevant for flood risk analysis for any state in India at the district and subdistrict levels.
